# Data-Driven-Menu-Strategy-restaurant_orders
# Introduction
This project aims to analyze the operational data of a restaurant or a similar food business to develop data-driven business strategies. In today's competitive market, gaining a competitive edge by making decisions based on data, rather than just intuition, is crucial. This analysis provides in-depth insights into various areas, from the performance of menu items and customer behavior to peak hours and the most profitable products. The resulting information enables the business to take concrete steps to increase revenue, optimize costs, and maximize customer satisfaction.

# Aim
The primary objective of this project is to use business data to achieve the following strategic goals:
Menu Optimization: Identify which products are the best-selling and highest-earning to discover the "Star" items on the menu. At the same time, pinpoint low-performing products to reshape the menu accordingly.
Operational Efficiency: Analyze order and revenue volume by day of the week and hour of the day to determine the busiest periods. This allows for the optimization of staff scheduling and inventory management based on these peak times.
Sales and Marketing Strategies: Understand the most popular product categories and payment methods to create targeted marketing campaigns for customers. For example, promoting less popular items or offering special promotions during specific hours.
Ultimately, the goal of this project is to turn raw data into meaningful and actionable insights, helping the business become more profitable, efficient, and successful.

Order ID: A unique number assigned to each order.
Customer Name: The name of the customer who placed the order.
Food Item: The specific food or drink item that was ordered.
Category: The category of the food item (e.g., Main, Dessert, Starter).
Quantity: The number of units of a specific food item in one order.
Price: The price of a single unit of the food item.
Payment Method: The way the customer paid (e.g., Cash, Debit Card, Credit Card).
Order Time: The exact date and time the order was placed.
Year: The year the order was placed.
Month: The numerical month of the order (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February).
Day: The day of the month the order was placed.
Hour: The hour of the day the order was placed.
Month Name: The name of the month (e.g., January, February).
Day Name: The name of the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
Income: The total revenue generated from a single order item (Quantity * Price).
Meal Time: The time of day categorized into a meal period (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).


# ConclusionÂ¶
The conducted analysis provides crucial insights into the business's performance. It was found that top-selling items like Pizza and Brownie are "Star" products, yet the lowest income is generated on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Revenue peaked significantly in March and July, followed by a sharp decline in August. The analysis also revealed that cash is still the most common payment method and that income is distributed relatively evenly among main courses, desserts, and starters. The hourly analysis showed that the 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM period is the busiest and most profitable, but there are large fluctuations in order volume throughout the day

# Business Idea
Based on this data, the following strategic business idea can be proposed to increase the business's revenue and customer satisfaction:
Lunchtime Specials for Mondays and Thursdays: Lunchtime is already the busiest period. To further boost this volume, especially on lower-income days like Monday and Thursday, a fixed-price "Lunch Menu" could be created featuring "Star" items like Pizza and Brownie. This encourages customers to visit during specific times.
"Duo Deals" for August and Saturdays: To counter the lowest-income Saturday and the significant dip in August, "Buy One, Get One Free" or "25% off when you bring a friend" campaigns could be launched. These deals are designed to attract more traffic during these slow periods.
QR Code-Based Loyalty Program: The high use of cash may indicate a lack of a loyalty program. A simple QR code-based system could be implemented to offer exclusive promotions. This would not only boost customer loyalty but also encourage the use of non-cash payment methods.
